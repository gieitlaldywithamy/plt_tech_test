## To run

First, run the development server (using package manager of choice! replace npm with pnpm or yarn):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
## Requirements

The objective is to build a basic eCommerce web
based application (using NextJS) that integrates the
product and menu data from this DB

https://my-json-
server.typicode.com/benirvingplt/products

There are a few basic shopping requirements
A user should be able to:
- View a list of products, with their price/info
- Add products to a basket
- Navigate to a basket screen
- Edit quantity/remove items from the basket screen

Whilst this is only a sample application, it should be
built in the same manner as a production
application. Consideration should be put into data
fetching, state management, static typing and
testing.
Use whatever libraries you are most comfortable
with.
Basic styling is fine, using tailwind and making it
responsive would be a bonus

It is much more valuable to demonstrate how you
think about data/state management and component
composition than it is to make the components look
nice in this case.

Please don't spend more than a few hours working
on this. It does not matter if you cannot complete all
the requirements, please substitute code for
comments/explanation where applicable.
